# Fashion-MNIST-Image-Classification
The Fashion MNIST Image Classification project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify grayscale images of fashion items into 10 categories (e.g., shirts, sneakers, etc.). Built with Python, TensorFlow, and Keras, the model learns patterns from the Fashion MNIST dataset and accurately predicts the class of each fashion item.
